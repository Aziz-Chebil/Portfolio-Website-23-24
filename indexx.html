        <h2>Model UN</h2>
        <p>
          Model UN constitute a big part of my life. I did my first MUN
          conference in the pandemic, I remember how shy and hesitant I was.
          Yet, the idea of representing a country and speaking on behalf of a
          whole nation somehow impressioned me. Thus, I attended more and more
          MUN conferences online during the pandemic. Each conference brought
          new people, new ideas, and new perspectives for me. The more I
          participated in simulations, the more I became self-confident in my
          speeches, the more I learned how to convince my fellow delegates, the
          better I wrote positions and resolutions papers and the more awards I
          started to win. <br />
          Simply, MUN makes me happy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below you find the position papers I wrote as a delegate and the study
          guides I wrote as a chairmanship.
